    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add yeast mixture and olive oil, then mix into a dough.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a floured surface for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for 1–2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: sauté garlic in olive oil, add crushed tomatoes, season with herbs, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10–15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F). Place a baking tray or pizza stone inside to heat.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and roll it into a thin circle or rectangle on parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the base, leaving edges uncovered.</li>
        <li>Add mozzarella slices and any extra toppings of choice.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer pizza onto the hot tray/stone and bake for 12–15 minutes, until crust is golden and cheese is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, top with fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and serve hot.</li>
